# Text Transfer Protocol (TTP) toolkit.

This crate provides generic types for implementing protocols with structure
and syntax elements similar to HTTP (e.g. RTSP, SIP, etc.). The goal is to
reuse components common to these protocols and help designing smaller crates
suitable for use in constrained environments such as routers, IP cameras, etc.
